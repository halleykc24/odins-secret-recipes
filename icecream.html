  <img class="recipe-profile-image" src="images/Thor.png">
  <h2>Thor has long since hung up his hammer. His days of war now over he spends his time baking, cooking, frying, and sauteing. His Thunder Ice Cream is the perfect thing to eat when lacking energy or confidence. Although, the secret ingredient may be hard for some to get their hands on.</h2>
